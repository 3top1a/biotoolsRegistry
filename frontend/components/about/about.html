		<h4>Built by you</h4>
		
		<p class="description-text">
		We depend on the goodwill and enthusiasm of our thousands (and growing!) contributors. If you are a software developer or an institutional 
		provider of online services, we encourage you to <a href="/register" target="_blank">register</a> these in <em>bio.tools</em>; you will first 
		need to <a href="/signup" target="_blank">sign-up</a> for a <em>bio.tools</em> account if you do not already have one.	
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">
			If you are responsible for one or a few tools and services, the easiest way to register them is to use the <em>bio.tools</em> 
			<a href="/register" target="_blank">registration interface</a> which is available once you are logged on.  If you are responsible for 
			very many tools and services, or have specific requirements, it is best use the 
			<a href="https://biotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_usage_guide.html">API</a> or to <a href="mailto:support-bio-tools@sdu.dk">discuss</a> first 
			with the <em>bio.tools</em> team.
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="about-section">
		<h4>Tool IDs</h4>
		
		<p class="description-text">
			All <em>bio.tools</em> entries are assigned a human-friendly, unique identifier based on the resource name, e.g. 
			<a href="/signalp" target="_blank">biotools:signalp</a>. <span class="bolder-text">Once verified</span>, a <em>bio.tools</em> ID provides a 
			stable way to trace software and data resources and integrate <em>bio.tools</em> data with other projects.	
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">	
			<em>bio.tools</em> tool IDs are URL-safe versions of the supplied tool name, which are occasionally shortened or modified as required to produce a 
			practical identifier. They are verified (and adjusted, as necessary) manually, to ensure they are practical, that the tool description is 
			reasonable, and that the entry does not duplicate an already-existing entry.
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">
			Once an ID is created and verified, it will not be deleted and the corresponding Tool Card URL (and Tool Card) will persist in perpetuity, allowing 
			for stable cross-linking and resource tracing.
		</p>
		</div>

		<div class="about-section">
		<h4>Built on standards</h4>
		
		<p class="description-text">
			<em>bio.tools</em> resource descriptions adhere to rigorous information standards including precise semantics and syntax. Scientific  aspects are 
			provided by the <a href="http://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/" target="_blank">EDAM ontology</a>  and technical aspects are covered by 
			<a href="http://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema" target="_blank">biotoolsSchema</a>. Both are open, community-defined standards to which you 
			can contribute.
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">
			The EDAM ontology provides a precise nomenclature (terms within a controlled vocabulary) for scientific characterisation of tools, including topic 
			(a category within the life sciences, <em>e.g.</em> "Proteomics"), operation (a specific scientific thing that a tool does, <em>e.g.</em> 
			"Peptide identification"), data  (a type of biological data, <em>e.g.</em> "Mass spectrometry spectra") and format (a specific data 
			serialisation format <em>e.g.</em> "Thermo RAW").
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">
			biotoolsSchema is a formalised XML schema (XSD) which defines a controlled vocabulary and precise syntax for some 50 general software attributes 
			such as name, description, software license and programming language.  biotoolsSchema makes heavy use of regular expressions, standard 
			identifiers and URLs (to refer to verbose information), enabling concise and consistent descriptions in <em>bio.tools</em>.
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">
			Contributions to EDAM and biotoolsSchema are most welcome.  For EDAM, see the 
			<a href="https://edamontologydocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_involved.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>. For biotoolsSchema, 
			head to <a href="http://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsschema" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

		<h4>Community-driven</h4>
		
		<p class="description-text">
			We rely upon scientific communities to improve the terminology and description of resources in different domains of the Life Sciences. 
			This includes the emerging <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/communities" target="_blank">communities</a> being fostered by ELIXIR, 
			and any other group of scientists with an interest to help out. See <a href="https://bio.tools/communities">communities</a> for an their tool collections (this is still 
			work in progress).
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">
		We allow to build tool collections called <a href="https://bio.tools/domains">domains</a> to display collections of <em>bio.tools</em> 
		annotations in specific thematic areas. Everybody with a bio.tools login can create a domain and add tools to it.
		</p>

		<h4>Backed by ELIXIR</h4>
		
		<p class="description-text">
			<em>bio.tools</em> is anchored within <a href="https://www.elixir-europe.org/" target="_blank">ELIXIR</a>, the European Infrastructure 
			for Biological Information. ELIXIR unites Europe’s leading life science organisations in managing and safeguarding the increasing volume of 
			data being generated by publicly funded research. It coordinates, integrates and sustains bioinformatics resources across its member states and 
			enables users in academia and industry to access services that are vital for their research.
		</p>
		<p class="description-text">
			<em>bio.tools</em> development is led by the <a href="https://elixir-denmark.org/" target="_blank">Danish ELIXIR Node</a>. Long-term support 
			from ELIXIR nodes, and engagement with a coordinated, European-wide community of experts, including national service managers, will ensure 
			that <em>bio.tools</em> remains free, open and maintained in the long term.
